Mark and john are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index).Which is calculated using the formula:BMI = mass/(height * height).
(Mass in kg and height in meter).
1.Store mark's and john's mass and height in variables.
2.Calculate both their BMI's.
3.Create a boolean variables containing information about wheather mark has heigher BMI than john?.
4.Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3.(Something like "is mark's BMI heigher than john's? true").

Solution::
var mark_mass,john_mass,mark_height,john_height;

mark_mass = 50;
john_mass = 60;
mark_height = 2;
john_height = 3;

//BMI = mass/(height * height);


var mark_BMI = mark_mass/(mark_height * mark_height);
var john_BMI = john_mass/(john_height*john_height);

console.log(mark_BMI > john_BMI)

console.log("is mark's BMI heigher than john's ?",(mark_BMI > john_BMI))

Output in developer console windows:

true
script.js:105 is mark's BMI heigher than john's ? true.
