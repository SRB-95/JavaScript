Solution::

var john1,john2,john3,mike1,mike2,mike3,johnavg_score,mikeavg_score;

john1 = 89;
john2 = 120;
john3 = 103;
mike1 = 116;
mike2 = 94;
mike3 = 123;
marry1 = 97;
marry2 = 134;
marry3 = 105;
johnavg_score = (john1+john2+john3)/3 ;
console.log('john\'s average score is:: ' + johnavg_score)
mikeavg_score = (mike1+mike2+mike3)/3;
console.log('mike\'s average score is:: ' + mikeavg_score)
marryavg_score = (marry1+marry2+marry3)/3;
console.log('marry\'s average score is:: ' + marryavg_score)

if (johnavg_score > mikeavg_score && johnavg_score > marryavg_score) {
      console.log('Team john is winner with score :: ' + johnavg_score)
} else if (mikeavg_score > johnavg_score && mikeavg_score > marryavg_score){
